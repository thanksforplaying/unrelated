# Unrelated
Chrome extension. Removes related videos and posts from YouTube, Medium and others.

## Why?
Because we’re weak. 

### Just one video/article... not so fast
“Alright, so I’ll just quickly watch this _one_ video and get back to work... Wait, that related video seems to be interesting... _Click_... Whoa, that video is _definitely_ worth my attention... _Click_...“ Three hours later, you’re still on YouTube, watching funny music cat videos. If someone would ask you how did you get there you won’t be able to answer.
You've got distracted. 

### Remove the distraction, because you can’t click what you don’t see 
Unrelated removes “related” section from major video and publication sites. If we can’t see related videos or articles, we can’t click them. If we can’t click them, we are left with only what we have originally planned. Just one video. Just one article.  

### Watch your video and close that tab
So watch your video and close the tab. Just because there are no alternatives. 

### Aren’t there another ways to be distracted? 
Yes, there are. But let’s do it one at a time. 

## Which sites does it work on? 
Currently it works on 
 - Youtube
 - Medium 
 - Amazon
 
 More sites will be added soon. 
 

## How does it work? 
It's a Google Chrome extension that inserts a bit of CSS that will hide that “related“ section. If you unselect a resource in the options, it will add a bit of JS to block inserted CSS. 

### I didn’t understand a word. So how does it work? 
No problem. The only thing you need to know that it doesn’t collect any data about you and sites you visit or doing bad things to your browser and computer. 

### There is a better way to achieve this
I bet there is. I don’t consider myself a good coder, but this solution just works. Feel free to improve it.
